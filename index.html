            An audio book is a recording of a text read aloud, either word for
            word or abridged. They are a convenient alternative to traditional
            books and an important media for the visually impaired. Audio books
            have come a long way since the 1930s when the first full length
            recordings appeared for people with disabilities. They were made
            available to the general public in the 1950s, but it wasnâ€™t until
            the 1970s with the release of cassette tapes that popularity began
            to rise, especially among commuters while driving. Today, we no
            longer use bulky recording formats to listen to audio books. New
            digital devices with space for thousands of files allow you to carry
            a library around, and download or stream audio directly online.
            Popular audio formats like mp3 files play on the majority of digital
            devices. Platforms such as Google Books and Amazon, provide access
            to huge libraries of books, while smaller non-profit organizations,
            such as Librivox, allow public domain access to free audio books
            read by volunteers.

            An eBook (or Electronic Book) is a version of a printed book in
            digital format. They are cheaper and quicker to publish and
            therefore provide a more convenient way to circulate literature.
            During the 1970s the Internet provided a huge step forward for
            sharing digital texts and making them available on screen and ready
            to download. By the end of the 1990s, publishers started to provide
            digital versions alongside their printed counterparts. EBooks are
            typically read using an e-reader, such as the popular Kindle,
            although most digital devices can read EPUBs, the most common format
            used today. Some devices even allow you to listen to the spoken word
            and read at the same time. There are plenty of free eBooks available
            in the public domain, from sites such as Gutenberg and although not
            likely to replace printed books in the near future, eBooks and audio
            books are changing the way we consume literature. Digitalbook.io
            aims to facilitate this by bringing together the best digital books
            from all the top online sources.

            Video is an electronic medium for the recording, copying, playback,
            broadcasting, and display of moving visual media.[1] Video was first
            developed for mechanical television systems, which were quickly
            replaced by cathode ray tube (CRT) systems which were later replaced
            by flat panel displays of several types.Video systems vary in
            display resolution, aspect ratio, refresh rate, color capabilities
            and other qualities. Analog and digital variants exist and can be
            carried on a variety of media, including radio broadcast, magnetic
            tape, optical discs, computer files, and network streaming.Video
            technology was first developed for mechanical television systems,
            which were quickly replaced by cathode ray tube (CRT) television
            systems, but several new technologies for video display devices have
            since been invented. Video was originally exclusively a live
            technology. Charles Ginsburg led an Ampex research team developing
            one of the first practical video tape recorders (VTR). In 1951 the
            first VTR captured live images from television cameras by writing
            the camera's electrical signal onto magnetic videotape.
